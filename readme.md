This is a university project. My first ever game Taco Trauma. Made with Unity.

Initially, I thought of making a hack and slash game, but my knowledge in making games was too little, and the given time was not enough, so I had to make a game with the knowledge I have now.
Therefore, I switched the genre to a time attack game. Simple concept. I'm proud of it as my first ever game. I made the sprites on my own too. For the main character, I edited an already created
sprite. For the Taco Monsters and Sandals, I made them on my own using Piskel.

Game Description:
Taco Trauma is a game that follows the misadventures of a hungry boy
named Niro. After indulging in a late-night snack at a 24-hour taco shop, Niro suddenly finds
himself in a dire situation. The tacos he devoured didn't quite agree with his stomach, and now
he must navigate through a chaotic obstacle course to find the nearest toilet before diarrhea
strikes! Niro is equipped with a giant spoon and infinite pink flip flops to fight off Taco Monsters.
