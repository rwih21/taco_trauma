This is a university project. My first ever game Taco Trauma. Made with Unity.

Game Description:
Taco Trauma is a game that follows the misadventures of a hungry boy
named Niro. After indulging in a late-night snack at a 24-hour taco shop, Niro suddenly finds
himself in a dire situation. The tacos he devoured didn't quite agree with his stomach, and now
he must navigate through a chaotic obstacle course to find the nearest toilet before diarrhea
strikes! Niro is equipped with a giant spoon and infinite pink flip flops to fight off Taco Monsters.
