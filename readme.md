This is a university project. My first ever game Taco Trauma. Made with Unity.

Initially, I thought of making a hack and slash game, but my limited knowledge of game development and the short timeframe made it challenging. Therefore, I decided to create a game based on the knowledge I currently have and switched the genre to a time attack game. The concept is simple, and I'm proud of it as my first-ever game. I created the sprites myself; for the main character, I edited an existing sprite, while for the Taco Monsters and Sandals, I designed them from scratch using Piskel.

Game Description:
Taco Trauma is a game that follows the misadventures of a hungry boy
named Niro. After indulging in a late-night snack at a 24-hour taco shop, Niro suddenly finds
himself in a dire situation. The tacos he devoured didn't quite agree with his stomach, and now
he must navigate through a chaotic obstacle course to find the nearest toilet before diarrhea
strikes! Niro is equipped with a giant spoon and infinite pink flip flops to fight off Taco Monsters.
